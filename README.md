# Recipes

This is the first project for The Odin Project, where we build a basic recipe website using HTML. The website contains a main index page and have links to a few recipes. The full project idea can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

I referenced three recipes taken from allrecipes.com and take no credit for their recipes: [Triple-Dipped Fried Chicken](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/89268/triple-dipped-fried-chicken/), [Whole Grain Waffles](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/88309/whole-grain-waffles/), and [Vanilla Milkshake](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/48974/vanilla-milkshake-i/).

I created a basic boilerplate for the main page and linked the three recipe webpages as an unordered list. For each recipe, I added an image of the recipe, a description, the ingredients list, and the steps required. I was able to achieve this using heading tags, a paragraph tag, an unordered list tag, and an ordered list tag.
